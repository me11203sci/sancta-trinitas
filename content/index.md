title: On the Dogma of the Blessed Trinity
---
To what [[Telos|end]] does [[Adam|man]] upon this earth sojourn, subject to toil ceaselessly in the company of [[Consequences of the Fall|thistles and thorns]], futile in staving off the dust that hungrily anticipates his return? Impelled by an intrinsic [[Motion|restlessness]] he passes over the face of [[Natural Order|nature]] and her [[Creature|creatures]], finding in them only a reflection of his own inevitable terminus and insatiable yearning. Dissatisfied, he turns inward, momentarily delighted to preoccupy himself with his seemingly unbounded [[Intellect|intellection]]; he scrutinizes himself, only to confront that brutal [[Evil|nothingness]] by which he is distinguished from beasts and from which precipitates his demise. Pierced to the heart by a torment honed by [[Reason|reason]], he cries out in anguish to a transcendent [[Existence|existence]] that must, [[Existence of God|of logical necessity]], [[YHWH|be]]. [[God|HE]] [[Scripture|answers]].
