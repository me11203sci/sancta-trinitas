# On the Dogma of the Blessed Trinity
To what [[Telos|end]] does [[Adam|man]] upon this earth sojourn, subject to toil ceaselessly in the company of thistles and thorns, futile in staving off the dust which hungrily anticipates his return? Impelled by an intrinsic [[Motion|restlessness]] he passes over the face of [[Natural Order|nature]] and her [[Creature|creatures]], finding in them only similitude in their inevitable terminus and in an insatiable wanting. Dissatisfied he turns inward, momentarily delighted to preoccupy himself with his seemingly unbounded [[Intellect|intellection]]; he scrutinizes himself, confronted by that brutal [[Evil|nothingness]] that sets him apart from mere animals and from which precipitates his demise. Cut to the heart by a torment honed by his [[Reason|reason]], he cries out in anguish to a transcendent [[Existence|existence]] that must [[Existence of God|of logical necessity]] [[YHWH|be]]. [[God|HE]] [[Scripture|answers]].
