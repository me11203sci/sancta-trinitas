# On the Dogma of the Blessed Trinity
To what [[Telos|end]] does [[Adam|man]] upon this earth sojourn, subject to toil ceaselessly in the company of thistles and thorns, futile in staving off the dust which hungrily anticipates his return? Impelled by an intrinsic [[Motion|restlessness]] he passes over the face of [[Natural Order|nature]] and her [[Creature|creatures]], finding only similitude in wanting and left with only a deeper sense of dissatisfaction. Turning inward, delighted to preoccupy himself with [[Intellect|intellection]], he scrutinizes himself only to collapse in confronting that brutal [[Evil|nothingness]] that sets him apart from mere animals and from which precipitates his demise. Cut to the heart in an torment honed by his reason, he cries out in anguish to a transcendent existence that must [[Existence of God|of logical necessity]] [[YHWH|be]].
